# About this Site

Once upon a time, I had free time to spare. I kept multiple blogs, each specifically for a particular subject that I found interesting and wanted to talk about. Now, I don't have nearly as much time, so I'm consolidating down to one blog. This one. Why not just post on social media you ask? I thought that was a great idea too, so my friend [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk "Kev's Homepage") and I founded [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org "Fosstodon"). Still, there were times where I wanted to say more than a five-hundred character limit would allow. That's what this blog is for. I'm not planning on sticking to a particular subject, but I expect most of what I post here will be technology related, specifically FOSS. Don't be surprised if I deviate on occasion.
