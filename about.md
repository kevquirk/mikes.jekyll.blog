# About Mike

Hi, my name is Mike.  I got started in IS/IT as a way to pay the bills while I was learning to code professionally.  After college, I dutifully got a job as a programmer working with a company's proprietary language. It took me three years, but I finally realized that I liked IS/IT work better. I left my programming job and got a job working as a Server Application Support Engineer. Five years later I left that job to move across the country and found a new place that would let me play with their really expensive Linux servers, but only if I promise to write some code to automate their processes and make sure their stuff keeps working. Seems like a fair deal to me.
